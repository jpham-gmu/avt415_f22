  <h1 class="h1">10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design</h1>
  <p><span style="color:purple">Summary: </span>Jakob Nielsen's 10 general principles for interaction design. They are called "heuristics" because they are broad rules of thumb and not specific usability guidelines.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>By <span style="color:navy">Jakob Nielsen</span> on Apr. 24, 1994; Updated Nov. 15, 2020 </p>
  <p>Topics: <span style="color:navy">Heuristic Evaluation,  Human Computer Interaction,  Web Usability</span> <span class="h1" id="h1">
    <!-- 1st set of two-->
  </span></p></div>

<div class="div2">
  <h2><strong>#1: Visibility of system status</strong><br></h2>
    <strong>The design should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within a reasonable amount of time.</strong>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When users know the current system status, they learn the outcome of their prior interactions and determine next steps. Predictable interactions create trust in the product as well as the brand.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2><strong>#2: Match between system and the real world</strong><br>
  </h2>
  <p><strong>The design should speak the users' language. Use words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than internal jargon. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <p>The way you should design depends very much on your specific users. Terms, concepts, icons, and images that seem perfectly clear to you and your colleagues may be unfamiliar or confusing to your users.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When a design’s controls follow real-world conventions and correspond to desired outcomes (called <span style="color:black">natural mapping</span>), it’s easier for users to learn and remember how the interface works. This helps to build an experience that feels intuitive.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2><strong>#3: User control and freedom</strong><br>
  </h2>
  <p><strong>Users often perform actions by mistake. They need 
a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted action without having to go through an extended process.</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <p>When it's easy for people to back out of a process or undo an action, it fosters a sense of freedom and confidence. Exits allow users to remain in control of the system and avoid getting stuck and feeling frustrated.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2><strong>#4: User control and freedom</strong><br>
  </h2>
  <p><strong>Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform and industry conventions.</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <p><span style="color:navy">Jakob's Law</span> states that people spend most of their time using digital products other than yours. Users’ experiences with those other products set their expectations. Failing to maintain consistency may increase the users' cognitive load by forcing them to learn something new.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2><strong>#5: Error prevention</strong><br>
  </h2>
  <p><strong>Good error messages are important, but the best designs carefully prevent problems from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions, or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.
</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <p>There are two types of errors: <span style="color:navy">slips and mistakes</span>. Slips are unconscious errors caused by inattention. Mistakes are conscious errors based on a mismatch between the user’s mental model and the design.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2><strong>#6: Recognition rather than recall</strong><br>
  </h2>
  <p><strong>Minimize the user's memory load by making elements, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the interface to another. Information required to use the design (e.g. field labels or menu items) should be visible or easily retrievable when needed.</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Humans have limited short-term <span style="color:navy">memories</span>. Interfaces that promote recognition reduce the amount of cognitive effort required from users.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2><strong>#7: Flexibility and efficiency of use</strong><br>
  </h2>
  <p><strong>Shortcuts — hidden from novice users 
— may speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the design can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.
</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Flexible processes can be carried out in different ways, so that people can pick whichever method works for them.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2><strong>#8: Aesthetic and minimalist design</strong><br>
  </h2>
  <p><strong>Interfaces should not contain information that is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in an interface competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <p>This heuristic doesn't mean you have to use a <span style="color:navy">flat design</span> — it's about making sure you're keeping the content and visual design focused on the essentials. Ensure that the visual elements of the interface support the user's primary goals.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2><strong>#9: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors</strong><br>
  </h2>
  <p><strong>Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no error codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <p>These error messages should also be presented with visual treatments that will help users notice and recognize them.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2><strong>#10: Help and documentation</strong><br>
  </h2>
  <p><strong>It’s best if the system doesn’t need any additional explanation. However, it may be necessary to provide documentation to help users understand how to complete their tasks.</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Help and documentation content should be easy to search and focused on the user's task. Keep it concise, and list concrete steps that need to be carried out.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h2>Note from Jakob</h2></strong>
  <p>I originally developed the heuristics for heuristic evaluation in collaboration with Rolf Molich in 1990 [Molich and Nielsen 1990; Nielsen and Molich 1990]. Four years later, I refined the heuristics based on a factor analysis of 249 usability problems [Nielsen 1994a] to derive a set of heuristics with maximum explanatory power, resulting in this revised set of heuristics [Nielsen 1994b].</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In 2020, we updated this article, adding more explanation, examples, and related links. While we slightly refined the language of the definitions, the <strong>10 heuristics themselves have remained relevant and unchanged since 1994</strong>. When something has remained true for 26 years, it will likely apply to future generations of user interfaces as well.<br><br>
