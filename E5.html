		<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Summary:</span> Jakob Nielsen's 10 general principles for interaction design. They are called "heuristics" because they are broad<br> rules of thumb and not specific usability guidelines</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h2>#1:</span>Visibility of system status</h2>
		<p1><span style="font-weight:bold;line-height: 1.5">The design should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within a reasonable amount of time.</span></p1>
		<p>When users know the current system status, they learn the outcome of their prior interactions and determine next steps.<br>Predictable interactions create trust in the product as well as the brand.</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h2>#2:</span>Match between system and the real world</h2>
		<p1><span style="font-weight:bold;line-height: 1.5">The design should speak the users' language. Use words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than internal jargon.<br> Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.</span></p1>
		<p>The way you should design depends very much on your specific users. Terms, concepts, icons, and images that seem perfectly<br> clear to you and your colleagues may be unfamiliar or confusing to your users.</p>
		<p>When a design’s controls follow real-world conventions and correspond to desired outcomes (called natural mapping), it’s <br>easier for users to learn and remember how the interface works. This helps to build an experience that feels intuitive.</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h2>#3:</span>User control and freedom</h2>
		<p1><span style="font-weight:bold;line-height: 1.5">Users often perform actions by mistake. They need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted action without having to<br> go through an extended process.</span></p1>
		<p>When it's easy for people to back out of a process or undo an action, it fosters a sense of freedom and confidence. Exits allow<br> users to remain in control of the system and avoid getting stuck and feeling frustrated.</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h2>#4:</span>Consistency and standards</h2>
		<p1><span style="font-weight:bold;line-height: 1.5">Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform and industry conventions.</span></p1>
		<p>Jakob's Law states that people spend most of their time using digital products other than yours. Users’ experiences with those other<br> products set their expectations. Failing to maintain consistency may increase the users' cognitive load by forcing them to learn<br> something new.</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h2>#5:</span>Error prevention</h2>
		<p1><span style="font-weight:bold;line-height: 1.5">Good error messages are important, but the best designs carefully prevent problems from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate <br>error-prone conditions, or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.</span></p1>
		<p>There are two types of errors: slips and mistakes. Slips are unconscious errors caused by inattention. Mistakes are conscious errors<br> based on a mismatch between the user’s mental model and the design.</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h2>#6:</span> Recognition rather than recall</h2>
		<p1><span style="font-weight:bold;line-height: 1.5">Minimize the user's memory load by making elements, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information<br> from one part of the interface to another. Information required to use the design should be visible <br>or easily retrievable when needed.</span></p1>
		<p>Humans have limited short-term memories. Interfaces that promote recognition reduce the amount of cognitive effort <br>required from users.</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h2>#7:</span> Flexibility and efficiency of use</h2>
		<p1><span style="font-weight:bold;line-height: 1.5">Shortcuts — hidden from novice users — may speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the design can cater to both<br> inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.</span></p1>
		<p>Flexible processes can be carried out in different ways, so that people can pick whichever method works for them.</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h2>#8:</span> Aesthetic and minimalist design</h2>
		<p1><span style="font-weight:bold;line-height: 1.5">Interfaces should not contain information that is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in an interface competes <br>with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility. </span></p1>
		<p>This heuristic doesn't mean you have to use a flat design — it's about making sure you're keeping the content and visual design<br> focused on the essentials. Ensure that the visual elements of the interface support the user's primary goals.</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h2>#9:</span> Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors</h2>
		<p1><span style="font-weight:bold;line-height: 1.5">Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no error codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.</span></p1>
		<p>These error messages should also be presented with visual treatments that will help users notice and recognize them.</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h2>#10:</span> Help and documentation</h2>
		<p1><span style="font-weight:bold;line-height: 1.5">It’s best if the system doesn’t need any additional explanation. However, it may be necessary to provide documentation to help users understand <br>how to complete their tasks.</span></p1>
		<p>Help and documentation content should be easy to search and focused on the user's task.<br> Keep it concise, and list concrete steps that need to be carried out.</p>

		<h2>Note from Jakob</span></h2>
		<p>I originally developed the heuristics for heuristic evaluation in collaboration with Rolf Molich in 1990 [Molich and Nielsen 1990; Nielsen and Molich 1990].<br> Four years later, I refined the heuristics based on a factor analysis of 249 usability problems to derive a set of heuristics with<br> maximum explanatory power, resulting in this revised set of heuristics.
		
		<br>
		<br>
			
		In 2020, we updated this article, adding more explanation, examples, and related links. While we slightly refined the language of the definitions,<br> the <span style="font-weight:bold">10 heuristics themselves have remained relevant and unchanged since 1994.</span> When something has remained true for 26 years,<br> it will likely apply to future generations of user interfaces as well.</p>
